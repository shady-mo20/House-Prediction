# House-Prediction
This project involves data preprocessing and cleaning of a dataset containing information about houses in Bengaluru, India. The goal seems to be preparing the dataset for further analysis and possibly machine learning modeling. Here's a brief summary and commentary on the steps taken in the code:

Importing Libraries: The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn's modules for data analysis and machine learning.

Loading Data: The dataset is loaded using the pd.read_csv() function from the Pandas library.

Data Exploration and Cleaning:

The dataset's basic characteristics are examined using methods like head(), shape, info(), describe(), columns, and nunique(). These help understand the structure of the dataset and identify missing values.
The dataset is examined column-wise to identify the presence of null values using the isna().sum() method.
Columns with a large number of null values, like 'society', are dropped from the dataframe using drop().
Null values in the 'balcony' column are filled with the mode of the column using the fillna() method.
Rows with remaining null values are dropped using the dropna() method.
Feature Engineering:

A new column 'bhk' is created by extracting the numeric portion from the 'size' column.
The 'total_sqft' column, which was initially stored as a string, is converted to numeric values by averaging values in ranges.
A new feature 'price_per_sqft' is calculated by dividing the 'price' by 'total_sqft'.
Outlier Removal:

Outliers in 'total_sqft' per 'bhk' are removed using business logic that assumes a minimum of 300 sqft per bedroom.
Outliers are also removed based on the 'price_per_sqft' by location.
Further Outlier Removal:

Outliers are removed based on the number of bathrooms compared to the number of bedrooms, using business logic that a home can't have more bathrooms than bedrooms plus one guest bathroom.
Data Transformation:

The 'availability' column is dropped as it is not deemed important for analysis.
The 'location' column is one-hot encoded using the Pandas get_dummies() method.
Encoding Categorical Columns:

The 'area_type' column is converted into numerical classes using a mapping dictionary and the replace() method.
Data Visualization:

A heatmap is created to visualize the correlation between the numerical features.
Overall, the code effectively preprocesses the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, encoding categorical features, and preparing it for further analysis or machine learning tasks. It's a comprehensive pipeline that covers various aspects of data preprocessing and cleaning. However, it's worth noting that the code snippet provided lacks comments and explanations for each step, which could make it challenging for others to understand without prior context. Proper comments and explanations would make the code more understandable and maintainable.
